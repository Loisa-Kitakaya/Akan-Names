# Akan-Names
## Description
This is a web application that generates for the user their 'Akan' name based on the birthday information they submit. The Akan names generated, are based on how the Akan people of Ghana name their children (They name them after the day of the week they were born on).
The web application has been built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As it is a web application, it is used only if one has a stable connection to the internet (no installation of any kind is required to run the application).
The Akan-Names web application implements the use of forms (in its .html file), functions, and control structures (in its .js file) to take user input, process it, and generate the Akan name.
